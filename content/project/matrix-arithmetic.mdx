An individual project for C Programing Lecture, KMITL Software Engineering, Year 1, Semester 1

## Project Description

This project aims to create a matrix computing program that runs in the terminal. The key features are:

1. Wide variety of operations

   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Scalar Multiplication
   - Exponentiation
   - Determinant
   - Transposition
   - Inverse
   - Adjoint

   \*Program will also automatically detect matrix compatibility when performing certain operations.

2. User can choose to input matrix through terminal/command line or from an `input.txt` and `input.csv` file with a user-specifiable delimiter.

3. Answer is automatically output in the `output.txt` file with proper matrix brackets and also generates LaTeX code for the user. The program also outputs answers in the `output.csv` file as a comma-separated value.

4. Answer is automatically stored in `Matrix Answer` so that it can be used to compute or perform further operations later on.

5. User can view each stored matrix value

## Demo

### Defining matrix through terminal/command line and through file (_input.txt_ or _input.csv_)

1. Select `Define Matrix`

2. Select a matrix to define.

To input through the terminal/command line, select the first option. Then specify `rows` and `columns` and `value` of your matrix.

To input through a file, select the second option. Make sure there is only 1 input file named `input.txt` or `input.csv` in the program's directory. Then specify the delimiter and the program will automatically preview the matrix it reads from as well as defining it.

\*_Maximum dimensions for reading matrix from a file is 100 x 100 with a maximum of 255 characters per delimiter (delimiter cannot contain `.` character as it will be determined as a decimal point instead)_

Suppose we have a file containing comma-separated values

We just specify the delimiter as a `,` and simply press enter.

### Viewing stored matrix

1. Select `View Matrix`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71577909/137595788-c4753f78-7b63-49bd-b62e-ee2c5236d20d.png)

2. Select a matrix to view and the value of that matrix will appear.

### Performing arithmetic

1. Select `Compute Matrix`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71577909/137595788-c4753f78-7b63-49bd-b62e-ee2c5236d20d.png)

2. Select an operation you would like to perform.

3. Suppose we select `Addition`, then we just select 2 matrixes to be added together and the result will appear. After pressing any key to continue, the result will be outputted into `output.txt` and `output.csv` which we will take a look [here](#looking-at-output-files).

\*_Answer is automatically stored in `Matrix Answer` so that it can be used to compute or perform further operations later on._

### Looking at output files

In the `output.txt`, there will be an answer with proper matrix brackets and a generated LaTeX code for the answer.

In the `output.csv`, there will be a comma-separated answer. The `output.csv` file is separated so that it can be imported into other programs right away.

## Testing Scheme

Suppose `matrix A` is

    4	7
    2	6

### First Test (Adding and Subtracting)

Adding `matrix A` together must give out

    8	14
    4	12

And subtracting the sum of `matrix A` with `matrix A` must give out the original value of `matrix A`

    4	7
    2	6

### Second Test (Multiplying and Inverse)

Finding the inverse of `matrix A` must give out

    0.60    -0.70
    -0.20   0.40

And multiplying the the inverse of `matrix A` with `matrix A` must give out `identity matrix`

    1	0
    0	1

### Third Test (Determinant and Adjoint)

Finding the determinant of `matrix A` must give out

    10

Finding adjoint of `matrix A` must give out

    6	-7
    -2	4

Multiplying `1/det(A)` with the adjoint of `matrix A` must give out the inverse of `matrix A`

    0.60    -0.70
    -0.20   0.40

### Fourth Test (Error Messages)

Suppose `matrix B` is

    1	2	3
    4	5	6
    7	8	9

Adding/subtracting/multiplying `matrix A` with `matrix B` must give out _incompatible matrix dimension error_

    Incompatible matrix dimension!

Finding determinant/inverse of a matrix with unequal row and column must give out _unequal matrix dimension error_

    Matrix dimension must be equal!

Finding the inverse of `matrix B` must give out _det equal 0 error_ because an inverse of a matrix with _det = 0_ does not exist (_singular matrix_)

    Cannot find inverse of singular matrix!

Reading matrix from empty input file must give out _input file is empty error_

    Input file is empty!

Deleting `input.txt` or `input.csv` and reading matrix from it must give out _error accessing input file error_

    Error accessing input file!

Setting `output.txt` or `output.csv` to _read-only_ and outputting matrix to it must give out _error accessing output file error_

    Error accessing output file!
