## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v6 or higher)

If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

After checking the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dulapahv/CodeX.git
   cd CodeX
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   This will install all dependencies for the frontend and backend applications:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   > Note: Git hooks will be automatically installed via Husky when running `pnpm install`

3. **Environment setup**

   Create `apps/client/.env` using the template from `apps/client/.env.example`:

   ```bash
   BETTERSTACK_API_KEY=
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET_PROD=
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET_DEV=
   SENTRY_SUPPRESS_TURBOPACK_WARNING="1"
   TURBO_TEAM=
   TURBO_TOKEN=
   ```

   > Note: This is a personal project and the required API keys and secrets are not publicly shared. For local development, you'll need to set up your own credentials for GitHub OAuth, Sentry, etc.

## Development

To start the development server for both the frontend and backend applications:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can also start them individually:

```bash
# Start only the client
pnpm --filter client dev

# Start only the server
pnpm --filter server dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Test

All test commands can be run from both the root directory and their respective workspaces.

### Frontend Test

Both the frontend server and the backend server will start automatically. To run the frontend tests:

```bash
# In root directory or client workspace
pnpm test:client         # Run all frontend E2E tests
pnpm test:client:ui      # Run frontend tests with UI mode
pnpm test:client:debug   # Debug frontend tests
pnpm test:client:report  # View frontend test report

# Run in client workspace only
pnpm --filter client test:client
```

### Backend Test

The backend server will start automatically. To run the backend tests:

```bash
# In root directory or server workspace
pnpm test:server           # Run backend tests against local server
pnpm test:server:remote    # Run backend tests against remote server
pnpm test:server:watch     # Run backend tests in watch mode (local server)

# Run in server workspace only
pnpm --filter server test:server
```

## Build

This project is configured to build both the frontend and backend applications together with caching from Turborepo. To build the entire project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

However, you can also build them individually:

```bash
# Build frontend
pnpm build:client

# Build backend
pnpm build:server
```

The build artifacts of the frontend will be available in the `apps/client/.next` directory, and the backend will be available in the `apps/server/dist` directory.

## Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment through Deploy Hooks which trigger after the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline completes successfully:

- Frontend (client): Automatically deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Backend (server): Automatically deploys to [Render](https://render.com)

## Scripts

These are the available scripts in the project:

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start all applications in development mode
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm build:client     # Build frontend
pnpm build:server     # Build backend
pnpm clean            # Clean all builds, caches, test results, and node_modules

# Testing
pnpm test:client          # Run frontend E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm test:client:ui       # Run frontend tests with UI mode
pnpm test:client:debug    # Debug frontend tests
pnpm test:client:report   # View frontend test report
pnpm test:server          # Run backend tests against local server
pnpm test:server:remote   # Run backend tests against remote server
pnpm test:server:watch    # Run backend tests in watch mode (local server)

# Linting and Formatting
pnpm lint:check       # Run ESLint checks (frontend only)
pnpm lint:fix         # Fix ESLint issues (frontend only)
pnpm format:check     # Check formatting
pnpm format:fix       # Fix formatting issues
```

You can also run scripts in the specific workspaces

> Note: This will not use Turborepo caching

```bash
# Frontend specific
pnpm --filter client dev
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --filter client test:e2e

# Backend specific
pnpm --filter server dev
pnpm --filter server build
pnpm --filter server test:socket
```
