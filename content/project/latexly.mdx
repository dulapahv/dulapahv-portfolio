Mathematical typesetting shouldn't require complex software installations or steep learning curves. **LaTeXly** addresses this by bringing LaTeX equation editing directly to the browser, offering a clean, accessible interface for students, researchers, and educators who need quick access to professional mathematical notation.

Currently under active development, LaTeXly represents an ongoing effort to democratize mathematical typesetting through web-based tools.

## The Need for Accessible Math Typesetting

Traditional LaTeX editors often present barriers for users who need to create mathematical equations quickly:

- **Installation requirements** for desktop LaTeX distributions
- **Complex syntax** without immediate visual feedback
- **Limited accessibility** for users on different devices or operating systems
- **Steep learning curves** for occasional users

LaTeXly tackles these challenges by providing an immediate, browser-based solution that makes mathematical typesetting more approachable.

## Current Feature Set

The platform offers a focused set of capabilities designed for efficient equation creation:

### Core Functionality

- **Equation editor** with real-time LaTeX input
- **Syntax highlighting** for improved code readability
- **Live preview** showing rendered equations instantly
- **Comprehensive symbol support** based on KaTeX's extensive library
- **Symbol search** for quick discovery of mathematical notation

### User Experience Features

- **Export capabilities** to both image and PDF formats
- **Undo/Redo support** for iterative equation development
- **Theme flexibility** with light, dark, and system-based options

### Planned Enhancements

The development roadmap includes several features currently in progress:

- **Matrices builder** for complex mathematical structures
- **Equation optimization** tools (prettify and minify functions)
- **Example library** covering Chemistry and Physics equations
- **Enhanced LaTeX customization** options

## Development Approach

LaTeXly follows modern web development practices with an emphasis on accessibility and performance:

**Technology Foundation**: Built using contemporary web technologies with a focus on client-side rendering for immediate feedback

**Open Source Philosophy**: Released under MIT License, encouraging community contributions and transparency

**User-Centric Design**: Prioritizing ease of use without sacrificing the power of LaTeX typesetting

## Current Status and Transparency

Development is currently paused due to academic commitments, with active work resuming after final examinations conclude at the end of May. This temporary hiatus reflects the reality of balancing personal projects with academic responsibilities.

Despite being in active development, the core functionality is operational and available for testing at [latexly.dulapahv.dev](https://latexly.dulapahv.dev).

## Target Applications

LaTeXly serves several key use cases:

- **Academic writing** requiring mathematical notation
- **Educational contexts** where students need quick equation creation
- **Research documentation** with mathematical expressions
- **Web publishing** requiring embedded mathematical content

## Technical Accessibility

The browser-based approach eliminates common barriers:

- **No installation required** - immediate access through any modern browser
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across operating systems
- **Immediate feedback** through live preview functionality
- **Symbol discovery** through searchable interface

## Future Vision

While currently focused on core equation editing capabilities, LaTeXly aims to become a comprehensive mathematical typesetting solution that maintains simplicity while expanding functionality based on user feedback and community contributions.

The complete source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dulapahv/LaTeXly), welcoming contributions from the mathematical and development communities.
