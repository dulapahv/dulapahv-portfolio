Issho (一緒) means "together" in Japanese - and that's exactly what this app is about. It's a real-time collaborative calendar that lets you and your friends visually mark your availability and instantly find the perfect time to meet, without the endless back-and-forth messages or creating yet another account.

## The Problem

After finishing my studies in the UK, I had a precious 2-month window to visit family and friends in Thailand before returning to work. I wanted to make every moment count, planning meetups efficiently to see everyone I'd missed.

But coordinating was a nightmare:
- "Are you free next week?" 
- "Which days work for you?"
- "How about Thursday? Oh wait, John can't make it..."
- *Creates a poll*
- *Half the group doesn't respond*
- *Repeat for every single meetup*

Sound familiar? I was spending more time planning than actually meeting people. There had to be a better way.

## The Solution

Issho was born from this frustration. Instead of exchanging dozens of messages, what if everyone could just paint their availability on a shared calendar? No signup, no downloads, just pure simplicity.

Here's how it works:
1. **Create a calendar** - Get a unique 8-character ID and 6-digit PIN instantly
2. **Share with friends** - Send them the credentials (one message!)
3. **Everyone marks their availability** - Just click and drag
4. **Find overlaps instantly** - The perfect time reveals itself

## Key Features

**Real-time Collaboration** - See updates instantly as friends mark their availability. No refreshing needed.

**Smart Analytics** - The app automatically shows you the best meeting windows, individual availability percentages, and when everyone's free.

**No Account Required** - Share calendars with just an ID and PIN. Privacy without the hassle of signups.

**Mobile-First Design** - Works perfectly on any device with responsive UI and intuitive touch controls.

## Technical Highlights

Built with modern web technologies for a seamless experience:
- **Next.js 15** for blazing-fast performance
- **Supabase Realtime** for instant synchronization
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** for reliable data storage
- **Vercel BotID** for invisible bot protection
- **React Big Calendar** for familiar, intuitive interface

The app features deterministic color generation (same name = same color every time), and automatic cleanup of unused calendars after 90 days.

## Impact

Since launching, Issho has helped coordinate many meetups. Users love the simplicity:

> "Finally, scheduling that doesn't require 20 messages"

> "This app is much easier to use than I expected"

The 2 months in Thailand? I managed to see everyone I wanted to, with minimal planning overhead. Issho had already paid for itself.
