As a Teaching Assistant for C and C++ programming courses at KMITL, I guided first-year students through fundamental programming concepts while developing my own teaching and mentorship skills.

## Teaching Responsibilities

### Lab Session Management

Supervised lab sessions for 50-60 first-year students, providing hands-on technical assistance with C and C++ programming challenges. These sessions focused on practical application of programming concepts, debugging techniques, and problem-solving approaches.

The large class size required efficient time management and the ability to quickly diagnose common programming errors while providing personalized guidance.

### Student Assessment

Evaluated homework assignments, lab exercises, and examination papers, providing comprehensive feedback to help students improve their programming skills. This assessment work contributed directly to students' technical proficiency and academic progress.

Feedback focused not just on correctness but on coding style, efficiency, and understanding of underlying concepts.

## Student Support

### Technical Guidance

Provided both in-lab support and additional assistance outside regular hours, helping students overcome programming challenges and understand complex concepts. Many first-year students were encountering programming for the first time, requiring patient explanation of fundamental concepts.

### Skill Development

Helped students develop debugging skills, proper coding practices, and logical thinking approaches essential for programming success. These foundational skills proved crucial for their continued studies in software engineering.

## Teaching Impact

Working with 50-60 students per cohort provided insights into different learning styles and common programming misconceptions. This experience improved my ability to explain technical concepts clearly and adapt explanations to individual student needs.

The role reinforced the importance of practical, hands-on learning in programming education, where students learn best through doing rather than just theory.

## Professional Development

Teaching programming to beginners strengthened my own understanding of C and C++ fundamentals while developing communication and mentorship skills valuable for future collaborative work environments.

The experience of managing large groups and providing individual guidance proved excellent preparation for technical leadership roles.
