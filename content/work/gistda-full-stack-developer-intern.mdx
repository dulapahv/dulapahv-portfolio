My internship at GISTDA focused on developing geospatial analysis tools for agricultural monitoring and fire prevention. Working with satellite data and mapping technologies, I built full-stack solutions that helped government authorities make data-driven decisions about crop residue burning incidents.

## Core Project: Agricultural Fire Analysis Platform

Developed a comprehensive web application that analyzed spatial correlations between crop cultivation patterns and crop residue burning incidents. This tool provided government agencies and authorities with actionable insights for fire prevention and mitigation strategies.

The platform processed geospatial data to identify patterns and hotspots, enabling proactive rather than reactive approaches to agricultural fire management.

## Technical Contributions

### Frontend Development

Built the user interface using React.js and Tailwind CSS, creating intuitive data visualization components for complex geospatial information. The interface needed to make satellite data and spatial analysis accessible to non-technical government users.

### API Integration and Development

Pioneered the integration of GISTDA's proprietary Sphere API Map into a React.js application as a reusable component. This work provided the public with access to example implementations and demos, expanding the reach of GISTDA's mapping technologies.

Designed and developed a dynamic API system capable of executing flexible URL queries while implementing robust SQL injection protection. This security focus was critical given the sensitive nature of agricultural and environmental data.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

Implemented NGINX reverse proxy deployment to enable external URL connections to internal servers. This configuration seamlessly served both the website and its associated API, optimizing user experience while maintaining security protocols.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Geospatial Data Complexity**: Working with satellite data and spatial analysis required understanding both technical implementation and domain-specific agricultural patterns. Close collaboration with GISTDA researchers was essential for accurate analysis.

**Government User Requirements**: Building tools for government decision-makers meant prioritizing data clarity and actionable insights over technical complexity. The interface needed to communicate complex spatial relationships simply.

**Security and Access**: Balancing public access to mapping tools with protection of sensitive agricultural data required careful API design and access control implementation.

## Impact and Applications

The spatial correlation analysis provided authorities with unprecedented visibility into agricultural fire patterns. By identifying relationships between crop cultivation and burning incidents, the platform enabled targeted prevention strategies rather than reactive responses.

The reusable Sphere API Map component expanded GISTDA's public engagement, providing developers and researchers with practical examples of geospatial technology implementation.

## Technical Learning

This internship provided hands-on experience with geospatial technologies and government-scale data processing. Working with PostgreSQL for spatial data storage and Python for analysis expanded my understanding of full-stack development beyond traditional web applications.

The experience highlighted how technology can directly support environmental protection and agricultural policy, demonstrating the broader impact of software development in addressing real-world challenges.

GISTDA's focus on satellite technology and spatial analysis provided unique insights into how government agencies leverage data for environmental monitoring and decision-making.
