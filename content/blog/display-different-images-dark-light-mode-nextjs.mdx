## The Problem

You might occasionally come across a situation where you need to display an image or logo with a solid color background. Often, the logo color will be solid white or solid black.

This becomes problematic when displaying the image on a dark or light background that has a similar color to the logo, causing poor contrast or, even worse, making the logo completely disappear.

## Initial Solution With Client-Side Rendering

If you're using [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes), you can use the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme and render different images based on the theme.

```tsx title="ThemeAwareImage.tsx" showLineNumbers
'use client'; // [!code warning]

import Image from 'next/image';
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

export function ThemeAwareImage() {
  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <Image
      src={resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? '/logo-white.png' : '/logo-dark.png'}
    />
  )
}
```

However, this approach requires client-side rendering, which can lead to a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) as the theme is determined after the initial render.

## Better Solution Without Client-Side Rendering

To avoid client-side rendering, we can use CSS to handle theme-aware image rendering.

```tsx title="ThemeAwareImage.tsx" showLineNumbers {27,34}
import Image from 'next/image';

interface ThemeAwareImageProps {
  lightSrc: string;
  darkSrc: string;
}

export function ThemeAwareImage({ 
  lightSrc, 
  darkSrc, 
}: ThemeAwareImageProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src={lightSrc}
        className='block dark:hidden'
      />
      <Image
        src={darkSrc}
        className='hidden dark:block'
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

With this approach, we render both images in the DOM and use CSS to show or hide them based on the current theme. The first image will be displayed when the theme is dark, and the second image will be displayed when the theme is light.

Building on this concept, we can create a more robust and reusable component for all our projects:

```tsx title="ThemeAwareImage.tsx" showLineNumbers
import Image from 'next/image';

interface ThemeAwareImageProps
  extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<typeof Image>, 'src'> {
  lightSrc: string;
  darkSrc: string;
}

export function ThemeAwareImage({
  lightSrc,
  darkSrc,
  className = '',
  ...props
}: ThemeAwareImageProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src={lightSrc}
        className={`block dark:hidden ${className}`}
        {...props}
      />
      <Image
        src={darkSrc}
        className={`hidden dark:block ${className}`}
        {...props}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

This approach allows us to render different images based on the theme without relying on client-side rendering. This not only improves performance but also eliminates potential FOUC issues. The `ThemeAwareImage` component can be reused across your Next.js projects, making it a versatile solution for theme-aware images.
