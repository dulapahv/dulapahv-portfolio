> *What if you chased a dream your whole life—only to discover your real passion just before it was too late?*

For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a doctor.  
Specifically, a heart surgeon.

That dream started when I was a child watching *[Iryû: Team Medical Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iry%C5%AB)*, a Japanese medical drama, with my mom. Something about the precision, the intensity, and the ability to save lives captured my imagination—and it never let go.

## The Dream of a Surgeon

For most of my youth, every step I took was toward that goal.  
I attended medical camps, university open houses, and volunteered in hospitals like Phramongkutklao and Ramathibodi. I even donated handmade face shields to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

My parents supported me, emotionally and financially. We invested heavily in pursuing that path. I attended events at top medical faculties—Siriraj, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine, Chulabhorn International College of Medicine, Thammasat University, and more. I also studied rigorously for exams like the [BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioMedical_Admissions_Test)<sup>1</sup>. Everything in my life revolved around medicine.

That is, until Grade 12.

## A Project That Changed Everything

As part of a required school project at Suankularb Wittayalai School, I joined a biology team working on:

> **An Experiment on Carnivorous Plants' Ability to Add Nitrogen to Soil**  
> *(Hypothesis: planting carnivorous plants in degraded soil might enrich nitrogen levels in an eco-friendly way.)*

This was meant to be another highlight in my medical school portfolio.

But I wanted to challenge myself and do more. So I asked a teacher if I could take on a second project—and he agreed.

That's when I started:

> **A Development of a Strategic Role-Playing Video Game to Reduce Student Stress**  
> *(A game designed to help teenagers relax and express themselves, built using [Unreal Engine Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine), [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) for avatars, and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for animations.)*

It was my first time exploring anything related to game development or programming. Even though Unreal's Blueprint system is visual and node-based, it required logical thinking, problem-solving, and a deep understanding of systems interaction.

And I was hooked.

I spent entire days building and testing the game, completely absorbed. It never felt like work. It felt like something I was meant to do.

## Realizing My Passion (and Facing the Consequences)

That project lit a fire in me. I wasn't just enjoying it—I was obsessed. I talked about it constantly and worked on it nonstop.

Meanwhile, I continued studying for the BMAT, still trying to hold on to the medical dream. But the contrast became unbearable. Preparing for medicine drained me. Coding energized me.

Eventually, I had to be honest—with myself and with my family.

I told my parents I wanted to become a software engineer instead.

It was one of the hardest conversations of my life.

We had spent years preparing for medical school. A lot of money had been invested. And worst of all, I made my mom cry. My family didn't fully understand what software engineers do—they imagined me fixing PCs in a department store.

We argued for nearly a year.

But I didn't give up. I showed them how serious I was: spending hours each day coding, enrolling in challenging courses like Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50) (even though the C language nearly broke me at the time), and researching universities that could support this new path.

I also completed my first Scratch project as part of CS50:

Gradually, they began to believe in me too.

## Choosing My Path

In the end, I applied to both medical and engineering programs.

I was rejected by every medical faculty.  
But I was accepted into every engineering and computer science one.

I chose the double degree in Software Engineering from **KMITL and the University of Glasgow**, believing it offered the strongest combination of academic depth and international opportunity.  
The University of Glasgow is ranked among the top 100 universities in the world<sup>2</sup>.

Even though I started later than most of my peers—many of whom had been coding since childhood—I was determined to catch up. I practiced every day using platforms like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/), and I documented my journey at [github.com/dulapahv/PracticeCoding](https://github.com/dulapahv/PracticeCoding).

## Where I Am Now

Today, I hold a **First Class Honours degree from the University of Glasgow**.  
I secured a return offer from my internship in the UK before I even graduated.  
I have a full-time job lined up—and most importantly, I love what I do.

I made my parents proud.  
I made *myself* proud.

## Looking Back

Looking back, I didn't fail at becoming a doctor—I simply discovered a better way to help people, in a way that felt right for me.

That childhood desire to improve lives never went away. I've just taken a different route to get there. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll build something in health tech, medical AI, or digital well-being—blending the two worlds that shaped who I am.

If you're someone who's scared to change direction, or afraid it's “too late” to start something new—trust your passion. It might just lead you somewhere even better.

<sup>1</sup> BMAT has been discontinued since 2023, but it was a standardized test used for medical school admissions in the UK and some other countries.  
<sup>2</sup> According to the Times Higher Education Rankings, the University of Glasgow was ranked 92nd globally in 2021 and improved to 87th in 2025.
